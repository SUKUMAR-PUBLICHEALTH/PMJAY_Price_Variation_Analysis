# ML & Markov-Based Decision Support System for PM-JAY Cardiac Pricing

## Objective
To develop an end-to-end **decision support system** that evaluates PM-JAY cardiac package pricing by integrating **health economics, machine learning, and Markov decision modeling**, with the goal of reducing catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) in India.

This project extends beyond price comparison and provides **data-driven policy recommendations** for tariff optimization and financial risk protection.

---

## Background
PM-JAY aims to provide financial protection for secondary and tertiary healthcare. However, large price differences between PM-JAY reimbursement rates and private hospital charges—especially for cardiac procedures—may limit provider participation and increase patient OOPE.

This project addresses this challenge using **advanced analytics and decision modeling**.

---

## Data Sources
- Publicly available PM-JAY Health Benefit Package (HBP) rates  
- Market-reported private hospital pricing data for cardiac procedures  
- Geographic and system-level variables (state, hospital type, procedure category)

> All data are secondary, anonymized, and used for academic and policy demonstration purposes.

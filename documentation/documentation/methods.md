## Study Design
This is a descriptive, cross-sectional comparative analysis of PM-JAY package rates and private hospital prices for cardiac procedures.

## Data Processing
- Raw data were cleaned and standardized using Python
- Column names and price formats were harmonized
- Procedure-wise averages were computed

## Analysis
- Absolute price gaps (Private − PM-JAY) were calculated
- Price ratios (Private / PM-JAY) were derived
- SQL queries were used to replicate and validate calculations

## Visualization
- Interactive dashboards were developed using Tableau Public
- Procedure-wise comparisons and pricing disparities were visualized
